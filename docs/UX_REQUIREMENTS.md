# AviJourney V0.3 UX Requirements

## Navigation

Primary portrait navigation: Radar, Map, Cards, Saved. Landscape may adapt placement, but all controls remain inside safe areas.

## Header

Show AviJourney identity, development version, feed status and visible-aircraft count. OpenSky is a provider, not the product brand.

## Radar

- Default 20 NM.
- Tap range badge for 20 / 80 / 140 / 200 NM.
- Wider range reduces label density.
- Selected target remains identifiable.
- Trails are observed historical positions only.

## Map

Must behave like a real map application: pinch zoom, pan, geographic marker alignment, selectable aircraft and persistent viewport while switching views.

## Cards

Route example:

```text
LHR                      EXT
London Heathrow          Exeter Airport
        -------->
```

Airport name is secondary but readable. Never invent an IATA code.

## Identity hierarchy

1. verified commercial number;
2. callsign;
3. registration;
4. ICAO24.

If both verified commercial number and callsign exist, show both with commercial number primary.

## Settings

Refresh interval belongs in settings. Suggested choices: 30 seconds, 60 seconds (recommended initial free-use default), 2 minutes, 5 minutes.

## Status language

Connecting, Live, Cached, Offline, Rate limited, Feed error. Cached data should show age when practical.

## Accessibility/readability

Do not rely solely on colour for climb/descent/selection. Use comfortable touch targets, respect text scaling where possible and prevent label clutter from obscuring controls.
